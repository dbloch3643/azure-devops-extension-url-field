# URL Field - a custom work item control
## Azure DevOps extension

### Usage

This custom control allows you to add a clickable URL on your workitem form, that can optionally use another field as a variable in that URL. Depending on your needs, there are three different ways you can use this custom control extension:

1. A fixed static URL that is always the same for every workitem.
2. A dynamic URL that combines a static base URL with some parametres taken from an other field.
3. A manual URL that is fully based on an other field.

The typical scenario for this custom control is option number two, see the following example below:

Let's assume that in your Azure DevOps instance, you have a custom field on a bug form. It's a simple string field that stores a ServiceNow incident number. Then, you can create an URL Field that would combine your SN web address with this SN number, e.g.:

URL `https://company.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=incident.do?sysparm_query=number={field}`
Field `ServiceNow Incident`

When you open your work item, `{field}` will be replaced by a value from a selected field. Have a look at screenshots to see the output.

For scenario 1, you simple need to skip `{field}` in URL option, so nothing is replaced (a fixed link).
For scenario 3, you simple need to enter *only* `{field}` in URL option, so everything is replaced (a manual link, fully based on an another field).
